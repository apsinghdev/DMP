## Project - Add Real-Time collaboration to Music Blocks


## Overview 

In this week, I will be building a minimal frontend layout for the collaboration room. This layout will render when the `collaboration`  button is clicked. We will be adding more functionalities to this layout but in this week, I'll implement it with a blank screen and a button to `exit`.


## Discussion with Mentors

In the last meeting with mentors, I presented a layout for the collaboration space. That layout contains an `exit` button, a `room` where the project will be shared among all the users, a component to `copy` the link and a `chat` section. Below is the image of the layout I presented.


Mentor Walter provided his feedback to first focus on the `collaboration` part first and get a basic version of it up and running. Also he suggested to consider other ways to integrate the `chat` feature like floating window, toggle etc for the best optimization of the screen. 


Mentor Devin also shared insightful feedback regarding the `chat` feature and overall layout. He also suggested to build a basic version and iterate later to build another features.

By considering the feedbacks of both the mentors, I've modified my layout by excluding the `chat` for now. 

Hence, I will be focusing on having a minimal frontend layout first and will add features in further iterations. 


## Work Objectives

I have raised a PR to add `collaborate` button in the project's `GlobalCard`. It got approved by the mentors as well.
Below is the image of the changes.


This week we also have to setup CMS for DMP and have to finalize the ticket to work upon. After this took place, I'll raise PR to add the layout. 

Additionally, I have finished some tasks of week-2 like setting up the server [here](https://github.com/apsinghdev/dmps) for local development and testing, configured `socket.io` and `yjs` and implemented server side logic.


Thanks for reading!
