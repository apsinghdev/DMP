## Socket.IO ( a library built on top of WebSocket to abstract complexities and provide some extra features )


1. Allows for custom event handling with a simple API.

2. Supports built-in events like connect, disconnect, and error.

3. Automatically falls back to long polling or other transport methods if WebSockets are not available.

4. Built-in support for automatic reconnection if the connection drops, with configurable reconnection attempts and delays.

5. Allows for segmenting the connection into different namespaces to separate concerns within the application.

6. Supports joining clients into rooms for broadcasting messages to multiple clients in a specific room.

7. Automatically serializes and deserializes JSON messages, simplifying data handling.

8. Allows for the use of middleware functions for tasks such as authentication and authorization.

9. Provides an easy-to-use client-side library for establishing connections and handling events.

10. Helps manage the flow of messages to prevent overwhelming clients or servers.


### Cons of Socket.IO

1. Higher overhead due to additional features and abstractions.

2. Dependency on the Socket.IO library, which may introduce compatibility issues.

3. Potential performance impact from automatic reconnection and fallback mechanisms.

4. More complexity in the codebase due to extra functionalities like namespaces and rooms.

5. Limited to environments that support the Socket.IO library.



## WebSocket ( WebSocket is protocol that provide bidirectional requests to enable real time communication )

1. Provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, allowing for simultaneous two-way communication.

2. Offers low-latency communication suitable for real-time applications.

3. Designed to be lightweight with minimal overhead, making it efficient for real-time communication.

4. An IETF standardized protocol (RFC 6455) widely supported across modern browsers and platforms.

5. Maintains a persistent connection, reducing the overhead of establishing connections repeatedly.

6. Supports both binary and text frames for flexible data transfer.

7. Provides a straightforward API with basic events: open, message, error, and close.

8. Can be used over HTTPS (WSS) to provide encrypted communication channels.

9. Can be scaled using various load-balancing techniques and server clustering.


### Cons of WebSockets


1. Lack of built-in reconnection and fallback mechanisms.

2. Requires manual implementation for advanced features like rooms and namespaces.

3. Less mature and robust event handling compared to Socket.IO.

4. Limited support for older browsers without polyfills or fallbacks.

5. More difficult to handle different transport protocols if WebSockets are not available.
